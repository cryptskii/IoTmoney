# Sharded Blockchain

This repository contains code and documentation for building a sharded blockchain system.

## Overview

Sharding is a method of horizontally partitioning a blockchain network to improve scalability. Transactions and states are divided into groups called shards that can process transactions parallelly. 

This repository demonstrates a basic approach to sharding using Rust. Key components include:

- **Shard** - Groupings of validators and states
- **Topology** - Network structure managing shard splitting/merging
- **Cross-Shard Transactions** - Routed transactions between shards
- **State Rebalancing** - Redistributing states across shards

## Getting Started

The code is primarily located in the `src` folder:

- `shard.rs` - Shard struct and methods
- `topology.rs` - Managing shard topology  
- `tx.rs` - Cross-shard transactions
- `state.rs` - State rebalancing logic

To run simulations:

```
cargo run --example simulation
```

This will run a sample simulation of transactions spreading across a sharded topology.

## Documentation

Further documentation on design and architecture can be found in the `/docs` folder. 

Key documents:

- `design.md` - High-level design philosophy 
- `specs.md` - Detailed specifications and algorithms
- `diagrams.pdf` - Visual diagrams of topology and data structures

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or PR for any enhancements or fixes.

Some areas that could be improved:

- Additional sharding algorithms  
- Alternative data structures
- Visualization tools
- Testing and benchmarks
